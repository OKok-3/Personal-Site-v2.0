                Consider this stage as my learning process for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Since I have just picked up the
                languages right before I started this project.
                There was a previous version of this website (v0.0), however, the website structure was a little bit messy so I
                deleted all the files and redesigned the
                entire structure and a little change of design for the cards. Unfortunately I did not separate the very
                first version of the website stage 0
                of the website, as I didn't really anticipate anyone would be interested in that. But, if you'd like to
                see them, the files for that version
                should be before commit 9 of the project.

            <p class="i-p_content" id="i-p_text_animation">
                For the initial design process, I used Sketch, a UI/UX design application on mac. As this is my first
                real world project, besides a few learning
                projects learning the languages, I only drew out a very simple design using Sketch. So some of the
                design you see here are probably not reflected
                on the Sketch design.
            </p>

            <p class="i-p_content" id="i-p_text_animation">
                Currently I have finished structuring the website, did some basic CSS styling, and put in almost all the
                contents. This project will probably be put
                aside for awhile until my summer session finishes. Below are the stages for this project that I planned.
            </p>
            <h3 class="i-p_stage_heading" id="i-p_text_animation">Stage 2</h3>
            <ul class="i-p_stages">
                <li class="i-p_stage" id="i-p_text_animation">Javascript animation (GSAP used for this project)</li>
                <li class="i-p_stage" id="i-p_text_animation">Adjusting stylings for the entire website</li>
                <li class="i-p_stage" id="i-p_text_animation">Refinded user experience (i doubt there would be any but anyways)</li>
                <li class="i-p_stage" id="i-p_text_animation">Improves the website's scalability</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="i-p_content" id="i-p_text_animation">I would consider this stage as a successful one. I summarized all the
                mistakes I made previously while designing the v1.0 of the site, and completely changed the design
                language for this version. I wouldn't say that this project is perfect, but it is miles better than
                my first attempt at coding CSS, HTML, and Javascript.</p>
            <h2 class="i-p_subheading" id="i-p_text_animation">Design Process</h2>
            <p class="i-p_content" id="i-p_text_animation">For the second attempt, I decided not to draw out the entire website on Sketch,
                the UI/UX design applicatin on macOS. Instead, I opted for the "design as you go" method, which was
                proven very inefficient very soon as I started needing to recode the entire website as soon as I
                change my mind on the layout of the website. Throughout the entire design/constructing phase, I
                reconstructed the website at least 10 times (ouch). Part of it is because I changed my mind on the
                styling, the other part is that I wasn't that familiar with HTML grid and flexbox structures, and I
                ended switching back and forth constantly between the two to try to figure out which one is better. So
                if I were to be given another chance at doing this project, I would design the project first before
                coding anything.
            </p>
            <p class="i-p_content" id="i-p_text_animation">The majority of the site uses the "flex" CSS display property as a way to
                automatically layout the HTML elements. There are some places that saw extensive use of grid, such as
                the landing page "index.html" uses grid to split the screen in two parts to show the current project and
                the slogan. Another place is the CSS cards you see in the projects page and the experiences page. I made
                the decision to use flexbox to style the website based on the ease of use of the flex property and its
                ability to dynamically adjust based on the client's window size.</p>

            <p class="i-p_content" id="i-p_text_animation">As proven by this project, prototyping beforehand improves time and efficiency by a
                large margin. So for my future projects, they will always be drawn out if they are frontend
                applications, or be logically designed first on a piece of paper or mindmap if they are backend
                algorithms or databases. Some styling for the website are not perfect, and I decided not to change them
                because it will require too much work and almost all of them are hardly noticeable. Most of the issues I
                had laying out the HTML elements are the div elements will sometimes be taller or wider than the window
                size of the client. As of today, I am still not quite sure why it happens, and my speculation now
                remains that the website's overall structure needs to be redesigned to suit my needs. It will be
                improved and looked at again during stage 3 of this project.</p>
